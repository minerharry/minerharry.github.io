  eigenfunctions have the same energy. The circumstance I safeguard against here by mentioning this
  caveat is essentially a cosmic coincidence - that two completely unrelated orbitals might, by
  algebraic happenstance, have the same energy, and thus be degenerate. Usually, the chemist’s answer
  is to pretend that never happens, whereas the physicist’s answer is to instead say ”there are no
  accidents” and chalk it up to some fundamental symmetry that our group doesn’t properly capture,
  and that therefore we should actually be using this other better group in which the spaces are more
  distinct.</span></p></div>
