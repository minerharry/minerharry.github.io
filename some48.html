never run into a scenario where the eigenvectors are not irreducible. The only case in which it could
really happen is that of a ”cosmic coincidence” - in which two wholly independent degenerate sets of
eigenvectors happen to have the same energy as each other, and thus form a large space of
degenerate eigenvectors. This happens sufficiently never in real physics to safely discount it; still, it’s
important that it be acknowledged. This document also shows that it’s not necessary
to make the assumption in the first place, as the process of finding the eigenvectors is
unchanged.</span></p></div>
